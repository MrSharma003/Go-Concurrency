Code Flow and Working:

==> There are two main functions: 1.Producer and 2.Consumer
==> Producer is impelemented using go Routine and consumer is just normal function call which is reading the data from channel "pizzaJob.data" iff there is some entry for pizzaJob.
==> Producer Working: There is only one go Routine which is running indefinitely untill it received any quit error from consumer
==> Error only produce when all the pizza making is done
